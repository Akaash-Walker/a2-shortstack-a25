## Akaash's Web Application
I created a web application that allows users to input their information to be stored on the site. A user can input their name and DOB, which is then stored into a table. User's can delete their information by inputting their name and DOB, which will remove their information from the table. They can also change their DOB by inputting their name , which will allow them to update their DOB in the table.
